--Make sure you have already downloaded all relevant CSV files from the Coursera class. Otherwise, this code will do literally nothing for you. 
--Q1 Write and execute a SQL query to list the school names, community names and average attendance for communities with a hardship index of 98.

--A1. I originally tried to use COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME with the ON statement, unfortunately that kept returning a no data error despite the code working with no errors.
-- Also changed community_area_name in the SELECT statement from CPS to CD which helped the retrieve the data correctly. Just some common errors in syntax. 

select CPS.NAME_OF_SCHOOL, CD.COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, CPS.AVERAGE_STUDENT_ATTENDANCE, CD.HARDSHIP_INDEX
from CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS as CPS
left outer join CENSUS_DATA as CD
on CPS.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER = CD.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER
where CD.HARDSHIP_INDEX = 98;

--Should output several schools with other info from select statement.
